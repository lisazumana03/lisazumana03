# Salulations, fellow readers
My name is Lisa Zumana, a Capetonian student, currently studying 4th year towards my Advanced Diploma in IT at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. Welcome to my GitHub repository, or as in Fabrizio Romano's words, HERE WE GO! I am a passionate young man who loves technology such as coding or gaming and I would like to explore Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency in the future.
